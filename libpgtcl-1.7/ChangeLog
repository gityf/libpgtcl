2009-04-06 Karl Lehenbauer
    * Pgtcl 1.7 released.

2009-02-26 Karl Lehenbauer
    * Make PostgreSQL helpers "res_dont_care" and "res_must_succeed"
      accept PGRES_TUPLES_OK as a sucessful result as well as
      PGRES_COMMAND_OK.

2008-05-24 Karl Lehenbauer
    * Add new pg_result suboption -tupleArrayWithoutNulls.  It works like
      -tupleArray except if a field is null, it unsets the field from
      the array.

2008-05-23 Karl Lehenbauer
    * Add "escape_bytea" and "unescape_bytea" to the methods that can be
      invoked from $conn.

    * Extend pg_escape_bytea to allow a connection handle to be specified.
      If specified, libpq's PQescapeByteaConn is used rather than
      deprecated PQescapeBytea, which can return incorrect results since
      it can't determine whether standard-conforming strings are enabled.

      If the "$conn escape_bytea ..." method is used, the connection-handle
      version is automatically used.

    * Detect if lo_truncate is available in libpq or not and, if not, return 
      an error if it is attempted.

2008-05-20 Karl Lehenbauer
    * Add support for the lo_truncate function that truncates a large object
      to a given length.

    * Version bump to 1.7.

2007-12-14 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Update autoconf build to Tcl Extension Architecture (TEA) 3.6

    * Extend pg_quote to allow a connection handle to be specified.
      If the connection handle is specified and the string matches the 
      null string, returns "NULL" (without quotes).  If not, returns 
      the string quoted for inclusion in SQL commands.

    * pg_quote can be invoked as a method of the connection handle
      as well.  For instance, "$db quote $string".

    * Removed unused variables and silence compiler warnings with casting.

    * Added "internal_position" and "internal_query" to the error options.

2007-02-08 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * Added support for async connections. Note that you will have to 
      use [after] command to find the result of the connection. Callbacks
      won't work, since the sock isn't established yet

2007-01-24 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * added additional sub commands to dbinfo (version, protocol, param,
    backendpid, socket)

2006-07-05 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Updated autoconf build to Tcl Extension Architecture (TEA) 3.5

2006-01-01 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * changed the commands that handle params, such that if a value is NULL
      then the lib will change the paramValues value to '\0' so that
      the backend will insert a NULL correctly

2005-11-27 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Bumped version number to 1.6

    * Add pg_null_value_string, ::pg::null_value_string and
      "$conn null_value_string" to get and set a special string value that
      will be returned for fields containing null values from queries.

      pg_select and pg_execute use this value for null values.  If not set,
      they use the traditional empty string.

      pg_exec, pg_exec_prepared, pg_sendquery and pg_sendquery_prepared use
      this value as well.  However, it can be overridden or replaced for
      one specific result using "pg_result $result -null_value_string NULL",
      etc, or by executing the result handle, as in
      "$result -null_value_string NULL"

      Updated documentation and regenerated HTML and PDF files.

2005-11-09 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * List -cmdTuples as one of the possible options when executing
      pg_result without arguments.

2005-07-18 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Made pggrok database introspection code much more useful -- routines
      for finding out data about fields and indexes in a table now load
      on array with data about each field (index) and execute a code body
      on it, rather than punting with a call to parray

2005-07-01 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Fixed memory leaks when connections-as-commands are used
      ($conn exec $statement, etc)

2005-04-16 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * added more documentation about the new capabilities

2005-02-25 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * took away pg::conninfo and pg::results, and made one command
      pg::dbinfo. Usage is pg::dbinfo connections and 
      pg::dbinfo results $conn

2004-11-30 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Document pg_exec_prepared, pg_results, and pg_sendquery_prepared.

    * Document pg_exec's ability to take optional arguments for 
      $-substitution in PostgreSQL 7.4+.

    * Documented pg_getresult and pg_result -error suboptions.  

    * Pasted connect string options from the libpq manual rather
      than simply referring Pgtcl users to the libpq manual.

    * Regenerated pdf and html documentation.

2004-11-29 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * Added commands to escape and unescape binary strings

2004-11-29 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Added library of useful PostreSQL helper functions to the playpen.

    * Added dbobjects PostgreSQL/Itcl-object interface package to the playpen.

    * Added pggrok code to introspect into Postgres databases to the playpen.

2004-11-23 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Simplify result object processing

    * Fixed bug in Pg_cancelrequest where the error message would
      not be returned.

    * Remove unused variables.

    * Silence compiler warnings about a fall-through (that couldn't
      be reached) that would cause a function declared to return something
      to not return anything and about a possibly uninitialized variable.

2004-11-22 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Created playpen directory where interesting things that are not
      yet ready for prime time can be examined and messed with.  
      Added code for turning OIDs returned by pg_result -lAttributes
      into data type names.

2004-11-19 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Updated autoconf build to TEA 3.1 / autoconf 2.59

    * Added import_sampledata_prepared_onetransaction.tcl to the tests

2004-11-17 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * minor optimization in connections-as-commands and results-as-commands
      where we don't copy and then swap, we copy it the way we want it to
      end up (first and second elements of objv reversed).

    * connections-as-commands and results-as-commands now error out when 
      called with no arguments

2004-11-16 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * libpgtcl will again build with versions of Tcl < 8.5 thanks to a little
      extra checking for HAVETCL_NEWDICTOBJ

    * Fixed several calls to Tcl_AppendStringsToObj whose arguments were 
      terminated with -1 instead of NULL, eliminating several segmentation
      violations that could occur while preparing error messages.

    * Removed spurious newline at the start of the error message when
      the query result handle passed to pg_result is invalid.

2004-11-05 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * added delete proc for result handle cleanup

2004-11-02 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * added delete proc for connection handle cleanup

2004-09-20 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * added preliminary support for dicts in pg_result. Need to have
      Tcl 8.5 or the dicts package extension. Need to set            
      HAVETCL_NEWDICTOBJ manually for now.

2004-08-23 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * added tcltest script of testing pgtcl.

2004-08-21 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * Made the result handle into a command, and added associated command
      dispatcher.

2004-08-18 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * Added another way to specify the connection string to pg::connect:
      pg::connect -connlist {host myhost port myport ...}. This is similiar
      to -conninfo, except that the arg is a key value list.

    * Added -connhandle option to pg::connect to specify the connection
      handle name. If not specified, then connection handle name is
      derived by pgtcl (as before).

2004-08-16 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * added Pg_results (pg::results, pg_results) command that returns
      the result handles for a particular connection

2004-08-15 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * Added new command pg::conninfo that returns a list of PG connection
      handles

2004-07-02 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * added basic capability to use the connection handle as a command
    * since connection handle can be a command now, I made the returned
      handle namespace qualified, with respect to the calling namespace

2004-06-29 Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * Added proper Tcl namespace support (i.e. ::pg::connect)

2004-06-28 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Version 1.4 released

2004-06-22 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Added new optional subidentifiers to pg_result $resultID -error. 
      You can specify one of "severity", "sqlstate", "primary", "detail",
      "hint", "position", "context", "file", "line", or "function" to
      get the severity (ERROR, FATAL, PANIC, WARNING, NOTICE, DEBUG,
      INFO, or LOG or a localized translation of one of these), the
      SQLSTATE code (see Appendix A of the Postgres manual), the
      primary human-readable error message, the optional secondary
      error message carrying more detail about the problem, the hint,
      an optional suggestion about what to do, the position, an error
      cursor position as an index into the original statement string
      starting from 1 (in characters, not bytes), the context,
      the source file where the error was reported, the line number of
      the source code where the error was reported, and the name
      of the source code function reporting the error, respectively.

      With newer versions of Postgres, $-variable substitution is now
      supported in pg_sendquery as it is in pg_exec.

    * Added a new function, pg_sendquery_prepared, that supports
      asynchronous invocation of prepared statements.

2004-06-21 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Added parameter support to the asynchronous pg_sendquery function.
      With newer versions of Postgres, $-variable substitution is now
      supported in pg_sendquery as it is in pg_exec.

    * Added a new function, pg_sendquery_prepared, that supports
      asynchronous invocation of prepared statements.

2004-05-26 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Changed configure script to use pg_config to find the path to
      PostgreSQL includes and libraries.

    * Altered libpgtcl to no longer require access to internal PostgreSQL
      include files.

    * Changed configure script to determine whether or not PostgreSQL 7.4+
      functions PQexecParams and PQexecPrepared are available or not.

2004-05-21 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Add pg_exec_prepared to execute pre-prepared SQL statements with 
      parameters.

2004-04-23 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Add pg_quote function to escape strings.  It adds the outside quotes, too.

2004-04-14 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
    * Modify pg_exec to support $-variable substitution for PostgreSQL 7.4 and
      above (protocol >= 3).  For example, you can now do stuff like
          pg_exec $conn {select * from foo where field1 = $1} $value

2004-02-14  Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * Updated with the fixes that went into the -core libpgtcl release
    * Also added fix for WSAStartup posted by anonymous on the bug list

2003-01-14  Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>
    * added -cmdTuples to pg_result (code submitted by Artur Trzewik)

2002-11-19  Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>

    * Improved the performance of -list a little bit

2002-11-15  Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>

    * Tagged for 1.4b3

    * Fix pg_listen.  (callback string wasn't properly terminated)
      Also made slight performance improvements in pg_listen.

2002-11-15  Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>

    * Cleanup memory leaks in pg_result.

    * Fixed bug in pg_result -assignbyidx

2002-11-15  Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>

    * Convert all the "#ifdef TCL_ARRAYS" where tcl_value was called if 
      defined and not called if not defined to always "call" tcl_value.  
      In the case where TCL_ARRAYS isn't defined, tcl_value is now defined 
      as a macro that returns whatever was given to it, making it a no-op.

      This change allows the code to be compiled with TCL_MEM_DEBUG enabled
      to look for memory leaks.

2002-11-06  Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>

    * Tagged for 1.4b2

    * Create the libpgtcl shared library in a way where it can find both 
      the Postgres shared library it needs (libpq) and the Tcl shared
      library it needs (libtcl).

2002-11-05  Brett Schwarz <brett_schwarz@yahoo.com>

    * added -list and -llist options to pg_result to return the
      results as a list and list of lists

2002-11-05  Karl Lehenbauer <karl-pg@sc.com>
