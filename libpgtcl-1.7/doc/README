libpgtcl.sgml is in docbook 4.2 format, and started out as the documentation 
from the PostgreSQL package when Pgtcl was part of the Postgres core.  

It has been updated to document the latest capabilities of Pgtcl.

The release ships with documentation in HTML and PDF form.

To build your own docs from the sgml source is beyond the scope of this
document.  For starters, though, you'll need openjade, pdfjadetex,
docbook 4.2, DSSSL Docbook (cygnus), and probably some other stuff.

"make" should make libpgtcl.pdf.  make dohtml should make the html subdirectory
and (re)populate it with html files documenting libpgtcl.

If you're using FreeBSD, it's pretty easy.

There are some good hints on everything you need and how to get it built
and installed at http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/docguide.html
