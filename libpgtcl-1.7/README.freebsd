libpgtcl can now be built under FreeBSD without any special tweaks.

We'd love some help in making this a port in the FreeBSD ports tree, so this 
build could be even more automatic.

For now, you need to build and install Tcl and Postgres

    cd /usr/ports/lang/tcl84
    make
    make install

    cd /usr/ports/databases/postgresql83-client
    make
    make install

You might need postgres-tcltk package, I'm not sure

    cd /usr/ports/databases/postgresql-tcltk
    make
    make install

Then run configure in this directory with the following parameters:

./configure  --with-tcl=/usr/local/lib/tcl8.4 --with-tclinclude=/usr/local/include/tcl8.4
