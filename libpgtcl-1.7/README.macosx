Configuration of libpgtcl under Mac OS X no longer requires any tweaks.

We'd love some help in making this a port in the Mac OS X darwinports tree, 
so this build can be even more automatic.

For now, you need to build and install Tcl and Postgres

    port install tcl
    port install postgresql

Then run configure in this directory with the following parameters:

./configure --prefix=/opt/local

Then do a "make" and a "sudo make install" or equivalent, and you should
be on your way.

There is also a version of Tcl included on the Mac in /usr/bin if you install
developer tools (I think that's what did it), and you'll
get this one by default (in all likelihood) if you just type tclsh from the
shell command line.  This version does not have /opt/local/lib in its package 
path (auto_path).  You need to either edit 
/System/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Versions/8.4/Resources/Scripts/init.tcl
to add /opt/local/lib to the auto_path or make sure you run tclsh from
/opt/local/bin instead of from /usr/bin, which may require you to type
/opt/local/bin/tclsh from the command line, or make sure that your PATH
environment variable has /opt/local/bin first.  This is not a libpgtcl issue.

Here's one way to start up PostgreSQL under Mac OS X:

pg_ctl -D /opt/local/pgsql/data start
