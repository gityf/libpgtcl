This is the playpen directory, where we put stuff to play with, mess with,
and evolve... stuff that isn't (yet) ready for prime time.

    datatypes - code for playing with data type oids and names

    dbobjects - code for creating and populating Itcl objects from Postgres

    pggrok - code for introspecting into postgres, finding out tables, users,
    etc.

    pghelpers - utility code for generating insert statements from arrays
    of key-value pairs and stuff like that
